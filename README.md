# Emul8tor

Emul8tor is an emulator for the CHIP-8 architecture.

The goal of this project is to teach myself (and others, perhaps) about the basics of emulation.

## Features

The emulator is pretty accurate. I've tested it with a bunch of ROMs, including an 8 ROM test suite, and they all worked fine.

## Building and Running

### Linux
In the root directory, run the following commands:
```
make
./emul8tor path/to/your/rom.ch8
```

### MacOS
I have never used MacOS in my life and I have absolutely no idea how it works. I do know it's Linux-based or something so perhaps the commands
listed above will work?

### Windows
I dunno... If you have WSL then you can simply build and run it there.
